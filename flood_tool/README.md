# Flood Risk Prediction tool

## Deadline 4pm GMT Friday 17th December 2021

### Key Requirements

Your project must provide a number of required postcodes:

 - Methods to convert between GPS latitude-longitude coordinates and UK OS eastings and northings.
 - Methods to classify the flood probability for unlabelled postcodes and to estimate the average property value for a postcode based on sample data provided to you.
 - A method to find the rainfall near a given postcode from provided rainfall and river level data.

 You should also try to provide visualization and analysis tools for the postcode, rainfall and river data provided to you.
 
 Your code should have installation instructions and basic documentation, either as docstrings, a full manual or both.

 ### Installation Guide

*To be written during the week*

### User instructions

*To be written during the week*

### Documentation

_This section can be updated during the week._

The code includes [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation. On systems with Sphinx installed, this can be build by running

```
python -m sphinx docs html
```

then viewing the generated `index.html` file in the `html` directory in your browser.

For systems with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed, a manual pdf can be generated by running

```bash
python -m sphinx  -b latex docs latex
```

Then following the instructions to process the `FloodTool.tex` file in the `latex` directory in your browser.

### Testing

The tool includes several tests, which you can use to checki its operation on your system. With [pytest](https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest) installed, these can be run with

```bash
python -m pytest flood_tool
```
